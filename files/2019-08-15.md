Yumeng's arrival at Amherst to pursue her Ph.D career!

This is Yumeng's first day to Amherst, MA.

Well... she had no idea on where to get food or how to get bus.

But! There is a home sharing tomato on the way to university!

And Luckily! A bird gave Yumeng an apple when she passed an orchard in the north of university!

(It's soooooo sweet!!!)
