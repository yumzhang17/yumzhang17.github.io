Hi, Amherst!

This is Yumeng's first day to Amherst, MA.

Well... she had no idea on where to get food or how to get bus.

But! There is a home sharing tomato on the way to university!

And Luckily! A bird gave Yumeng an apple when she passed an orchard in the north of university!

(It's soooooo sweet!!!)
