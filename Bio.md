### About Yumeng:

**Heyooo!** I am Yumeng Zhang, I am a computational biochemist. I currently work as a postdoc associate at [Prof. Zhang's Lab](https://zhanggroup.mit.edu/). My current research interest is to use machine-learning and Molecular dynamics simulations to understand the large scale biomolecular activities (like liquid-liquid phase separation.)

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue;">I had my Ph.D. degree from University of Massachusetts Amherst on 2024 Feb.</span> I was a grad student in [Prof. Chen's lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/). <span style="color: grey;">(Many unforgettable and vivid memories there! wow!)</span>

I am still not 100% sure about the direction of my future career... But I am walking on the academic path towards science (for now, on 2024).

Life Yumeng is a father of two cats (Tricky and Twinkle), a lover of video games, and ACGer.
