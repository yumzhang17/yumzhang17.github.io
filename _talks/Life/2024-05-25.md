**2024-05-25**: Rhode Island travel with Dad.

Cannot imagine lol, though lived in MA for almost 5 years, I havn't even been to RI. Thanks to dad's coming!! I finnaly planed a trip here!

As an ISFP, I am so proud of my "J" ability!! At the night of Friday, I am still wondering if I would execute the trip. However, when I woke up at 3:30 AM, realizing that we might be able to catch the sun rise, we immediately started our trip!

The Cliffwalk is amazing! And The Breakers is cool :D ! (Let's fight for it lol!). And we passed the SALVE REGINA University, which ranks 3% best location univerisities in U.S.
