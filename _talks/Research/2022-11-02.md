**2022-11-02**: The first time Yumeng gave talks in public!

Yumeng gave a talk in Chalk_Talk to introduce one of her beautiful work on [HyRes II](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00974). 

A short movie for IDP simulations in HyRes II is shown below:

And she likes her slides with bunches of help&suggestions from her PI and labmates.

Especially the cool animation she made using AE.

(Though she is a little nervous, but this is a talk changed her!)
