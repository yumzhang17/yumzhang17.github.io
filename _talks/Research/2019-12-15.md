**2019-12-15**: After three rotations, Yumeng successfully joined [Prof.Chen's lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/)! 

The night receiving the confirmation email is indescribable. Yumeng did NOT do well in chemistry area in her undergrad period.

She is thrilled in being accepted to join the group, and also doubted if she was qualified.

But she was so happy to start her new journey!

(Will see years later later!)

Years years later, she still thinks this is her great lucky to join Prof. Chen's lab!!

陈老师，谢谢您！曾经把我从黑夜中带出来！

To Chen Lab members, Thank you! For helping me out from the darkness!
