## Bio
<div style="background-color: rgb(237, 246, 255); padding: 20px;"> <!-- Light Blue -->
<p align="justify">
Hi! I am Yumeng Zhang, a computational biochemist. I currently work as a postdoc associate at [Prof. Zhang's Lab](https://zhanggroup.mit.edu/). I am tring to use machine-learning and Molecular dynamics simulations to understand the large scale biomolecular activities (like liquid-liquid phase separation.)

I had my Ph.D. degree from University of Massachusetts Amherst on 2024 Feb. I was a grad student in [Prof. Chen's lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/). (Many unforgettable and vivid  memories there! wow!)

I am still not 100% sure about the direction of my future career... But I am walking on the academic path towards science (for now, on 2024).
