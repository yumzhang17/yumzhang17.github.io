## *Waku Waku*
Hi! This is Yumeng, currently a chemistry grad student in UMass Amherst. I am doing some simulation concerning research in [Prof.Chen's lab](https://people.chem.umass.edu/jchenlab/). Here, we bridge the bio-system (i.e., membrane proteins, tumor proteins, and cellular systems) with atomistic/coarse-grained MD simulations. We also develope the enhanced sampling methods for more accurate and faster samplings :3
